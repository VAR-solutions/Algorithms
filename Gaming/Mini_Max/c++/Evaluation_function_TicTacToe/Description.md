# Introduction to Evaluation Function
In the real world when we are creating a program to play Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Backgamon, etc. we need to implement a function that calculates the value of the board depending on the placement of pieces on the board. This function is often known as Evaluation Function. It is sometimes also called Heuristic Function.

The evaluation function is unique for every type of game. In this post, evaluation function for the game Tic-Tac-Toe is discussed. The basic idea behind the evaluation function is to give a high value for a board if maximizer‘s turn or a low value for the board if minimizer‘s turn.
