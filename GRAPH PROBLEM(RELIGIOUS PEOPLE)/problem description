Amritsar is the largest and most important city in punjab and is a cultural and transportation centre.
It is also the centre of Sikhism and the site of the Sikh's principal place of worship-the HarmandirSahib,
or Golden temple.Let us consider
There are N cities in Amritsar numbered from 1 to N.
Due to a storm, every road in Amritsar was destroyed and now no temples are left.
There are 2 types of operations :

You can construct a temple by giving away A dollars in ith city.
You can repair an already existing road by giving away B dollars.

Your goal is to make temples such that people of every city have access to some temple.
People of the ith city can visit the temple only if :
A temple exists in that city.
OR
There is a path from that city to a city which contains a temple. (the path should consist of repaired roads only)
You have to minimize the total cost such that people in every city can go to a temple and output this minimum cost.

NOTE : You can only repair the roads which existed and not build on your own.

  N (which denote number of cities),
  M (number of roads which existed),
 A (cost to build a temple),
