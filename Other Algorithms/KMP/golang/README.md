# KMP Algorithm for Pattern searching
The Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm searches for the occurrence of a pattern of string in a text.
The main idea behind this algorithm is that when a mismatch occurs, the pattern itself gives sufficient information to check where the next match may occur. This reduces the number of comparisons among the characters of pattern and text.

It works on a worst case complexity of O(n).

The algorithm above has been compiled via resources from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/)
