PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below:
    2 : abc
    3 : def
    4 : ghi
    5 : jkl
    6 : mno
    7 : pqrs
    8 : tuv
    9 : wxyz

Example :
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

NOTE : Answer could be in any order you want.

EXPLANATION :
             2 can be mapped to 'a','b' or 'c'
             3 can be mapped to 'd','e' or 'f'
             Therefore possible combinations are : "ad" "ae" "af"
                                                   "bd" "be" "bf"
                                                   "cd" "ce" "cf"

SOLUTION :
We can use Recursion to solve this problem.
The idea is to consider every input digit one by one and replace the digit with each character in mobile keypad and recur for the next digit. 
When all the digits are processed return the result.
