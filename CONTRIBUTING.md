## Contribution
 * Contributions are always welcome. Language doesn't matter. Just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.
 * PRs are welcome. To begin developing, follow the structure:

   > Algorithm-Type/algorithm-name/language-name/file-name.extension
   
   e.g
   > Sorting/bubble-sort/python/bubble-sort.py

 * If there is an implementation of the same algorithm in your language, do not give a PR for that.
 * Please include a description for the algorithm that you are implementing. It doesn't matter if it's copied from somewhere as long as it helps people that are learning new algorithm.
 * Graphical examples would be very helpful too.
 * You can include tests as well.
 * Don't remove previous implementations of algorithms. Just add a new file with your own implementation.
 * Beautify and clean up your code for easier reading
 ### Note:
 * If your PR is closed without any comment, it means that your PR does not meet the above criteria. Make sure your PR is **not Duplicate** and it should be **well-documented**.
