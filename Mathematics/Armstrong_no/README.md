# Armstrong Number
An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For instance, a 3 digit number will be considered an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 

```
For example, 153 is an Armstrong number, as 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3 = 153
