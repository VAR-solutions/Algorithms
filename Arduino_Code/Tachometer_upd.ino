/* This Arduino Project Calculates RPM of any DC Wheeled Motor
Before attempting this project try to get some knowledge about 
IR Proximity Sensor module. For this project you will need a dc motor 
and wheel with **half black and half white** template on the wheel rim.
Main concept of IR Tachometer is transmission and reflection of IR signal.
