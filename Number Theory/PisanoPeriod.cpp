/*
In number theory, the nth Pisano period, written Ï€(n), is the period with
which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo n repeats. Pisano
periods are named after Leonardo Pisano, better known as Fibonacci. 
The existence of periodic functions in Fibonacci numbers was noted by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1774.
