''' A recursive Python3 program to find Grundy Number for 
a game which is like a one-pile version of Nim. 
Game Description : The game starts with a pile of n stones, 
and the player to move may take any positive number of stones. 
The last player to move wins. Which player wins the game? '''

# A Function to calculate Mex of all the values in 
# that set.

# A function to Compute Grundy Number of 'n' 
# Only this function varies according to the game
