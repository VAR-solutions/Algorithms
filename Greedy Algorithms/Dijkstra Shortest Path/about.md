About 
Dijkstra Shortest Path

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm finds a shortest path tree from a single source node, by building a set of nodes that have minimum distance from the source.

It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.
