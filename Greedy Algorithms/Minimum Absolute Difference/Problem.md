# Problem

Consider an array of integers, arr = [arr[0], arr[1], ... , arr[n-1]]. We define the absolute difference between two elements, a[i] and a[j] (where i != j), to be the absolute value of a[i] - a[j].

Given an array of integers, find and print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array. For example, given the array arr = [-2,2,4] we can create 3 pairs of numbers: [-2,2], [-2,4] and [2,4]. The absolute differences for these pairs are |(-2) - 2| = 4 , |(-2) - 4| = 6 and |2-4| = 2. The minimum absolute difference is 2.
