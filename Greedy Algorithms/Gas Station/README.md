## Description of the problem

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, ... n-1, 0, 1, 2..
Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.

Example - 
Input :
      Gas :   [1, 2]
      Cost :  [2, 1]

Output : 1 

If you start from index 0, you can fill in gas[0] = 1 amount of gas. Now your tank has 1 unit of gas. But you need cost[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1. 
If you start from index 1, you can fill in gas[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your tank has 2 units of gas. You need cost[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So, you travel to station 0 and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in gas[0] = 1 unit of additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you cost[0] = 2 to get to station 1, which you do and complete the circuit.
